# AI Content Transformation Suite - Backend

This directory contains the Python FastAPI backend application for the AI Content Transformation Suite. It provides the core logic for processing PDF documents, generating audio, creating images, and assembling storybooks using various AI services.

## Features

* **PDF Parsing**: Extracts text content from PDF documents.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion**: Converts text into natural-sounding audio using Google Cloud TTS.
* **Image Generation**: Generates images based on textual descriptions using Generative AI models.
* **Storybook Assembly**: Combines text and generated images into a cohesive storybook format, often outputting as a PDF.
* **Session Management**: Manages ongoing storybook creation sessions, allowing for iterative editing and regeneration of content.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: The primary programming language.
* **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
* **Pydantic**: Used by FastAPI for data validation and settings management.
* **python-multipart**: For handling file uploads.
* **Google Cloud Client Libraries**: For interacting with Google's AI services (e.g., Text-to-Speech, Generative AI).
* **PyPDF2**: For PDF manipulation and parsing.

## Setup (Backend Only)

If you wish to run the backend application independently of the Docker Compose setup, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with your Google API Key:

   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

   *Note: Ensure your Google API Key has access to Text-to-Speech and Generative AI services.*

5. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

### Audiobook Conversion

* `POST /audiobook/convert`: Converts a PDF file to an audiobook.

### Storybook Creation

* `POST /storybook/create-and-finalize`: Creates a storybook directly from text or PDF and provides a download.
* `POST /storybook/session/start`: Initiates a storybook creation session for iterative editing.
* `GET /storybook/session/{session_id}/state`: Retrieves the current state of a storybook session.
* `PUT /storybook/session/{session_id}/scene/{scene_index}`: Updates the text of a specific scene in a session.
* `POST /storybook/session/{session_id}/scene/{scene_index}/regenerate`: Regenerates the image for a specific scene.
* `PUT /storybook/session/{session_id}/details`: Updates storybook title and author.
* `PUT /storybook/session/{session_id}/styles`: Updates storybook font styles.
* `GET /storybook/session/{session_id}/preview`: Generates a PDF preview of the current storybook session.
* `GET /storybook/session/{session_id}/download`: Finalizes and provides a download of the storybook PDF.

## Project Structure

* `main.py`: The main FastAPI application entry point.
* `pdf_to_audiobook/`: Contains modules for PDF parsing and TTS generation.
* `storybook_creator/`: Contains modules for narrative processing, image generation, and PDF assembly.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.

Do you want me to also **remove session state management mentions** since they were originally handled via Redis? That would make the README fully consistent.
